### Section 1: Selling CI/CD to your Team/Organization

Benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation

#### Speedy Golive from Development to Producton: 
CI/CD enables developers to release new features and updates more frequently. By automating the build and deployment processes, developers can quickly deliver changes to production, reducing the time it takes to bring new features to end-users.

#### Early Bug Detection by automated testing: 
With CI/CD, code changes are continuously integrated and tested.
By catching and addressing issues early on, developers can prevent them from becoming larger and more difficult to fix later.

#### Production Level Quality from the begening : 
CI/CD encourages developers to write clean, modular, and testable code.  
This leads to improved code quality and reduces the golive time in Production.

#### Scale-Up and Scale-down
In case increase or decressed usage, CI/CD automated enable us to Scale-up and down quickly with no downtime.

#### Disaster Recovery and Rollback
In case of any issues or failures during deployment, CI/CD automated recovery, minimizing downtime and reducing the impact on end-users.

Overall, CI/CD helps developers to focus more on writing code and delivering value to end-users fast with quality and scalabilty.
